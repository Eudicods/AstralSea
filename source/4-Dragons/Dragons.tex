While ancient dragons commonly traversed the Astral Sea, they largely preferred to remain in material realms with easier access to treasures created by other races.
Some dragons were swept into the Astral Sea by the Theaceaen incident and have since made their home there.

The Illithid Empire sees these dragons as a powerful threat, but since they can typically be appeased with offerings of treasure, the Empire largely leaves these dragons alone unless they make a habit of preying upon the ships and citizens of the Empire.
These dragons have long memories and still distrust the Githyanki due to the old elven druids stealing and experimenting upon their young.

The Empire has managed to steal some young dragons, and these dragons are used as part of the Imperial Dragonrider Corps.
These elite troops are some of the most feared in the Empire, but the dragons resent their captivity and have to be kept under control with the use of arcane collars.
