The Githzerai are elves who managed to elude the Illithid Empire and Githyanki who have managed to escape the Illithid Empire
They have formed their own small communities in the Astral Sea.
The Githzerai have few allies but remain one of the strongest factions that has resisted the Empire.
The Empire sees the Githzerai as a minor nuance but they will immediately kill any members who were Githyanki who deserted their military forces.
