The Illithid Empire is the dominant faction in the Astral Sea.
The Empire strives to maintain stability in the Astral Sea and carefully reconnoiters other realms while trying to remain unseen.

At the top of the social strata in the Empire is Elder Brains and Mindflayers.
Other races can raise their status in imperial society and bureaucracy by joining with an intellect devourer, becoming host to these lesser Illithids and melding their mind and memories with those of previous hosts.
