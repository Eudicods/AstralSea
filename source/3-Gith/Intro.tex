The Gith were once elves from Theaceae.
They were pulled into the Astral Sea when the elvish druid's efforts to pull energy from the Astral Sea and the Fey realm ended in disaster, almost completely sealing Theacea off from the Astral Sea and the rest of the realms.
Two major factions developed as a result of this incident, the Githyanki and the Githzerai.
